Description: Compares R source codes by variable and/or functions names. Similar source codes should deliver similarity coefficients near one. Since neither the frequency nor the order of the used names is considered, a manual inspection of the R source code is required to check for similarity. Possible use cases include detection of code clones for improving
    software quality and of plagiarism amongst students' assignments.
